# [Trillions spent and big software projects are still failing](https://spectrum.ieee.org/it-management-software-failures)


**Tags: Software,IT Management**

Despite a three‑fold rise in IT spending, large software projects keep failing because managers repeat the same governance and planning errors; AI tools won’t fix the underlying human‑centric problems. The article cites costly disasters such as Canada’s Phoenix payroll system, the UK Post Office Horizon scandal, and numerous other governmental and corporate rollouts, highlighting trillions of dollars in wasted resources and urging stronger accountability, realistic project scoping, and disciplined leadership.

## Comments

**Sentiment: negative**

The discussion centers on why large software projects repeatedly fail. The most active threads cover:
1. **Incremental rollout** – many users stress starting with a tiny, production‑used system (e.g., a small town payroll) before scaling, citing real‑world POS deployments as evidence.
2. **Compliance and PCI** – several replies explain the difficulty of testing payment‑card systems in production due to strict security standards.
3. **Technical debt & scalability** – contributors note that early shortcuts create hidden complexity that explodes at scale, referencing Gall's Law, WhatsApp, and the need for modular designs.
4. **Management and accountability** – a large chunk of the conversation blames poor project governance, shifting requirements, lack of ownership, and incentive mis‑alignment, with examples from government IT (e.g., Canadian payroll, UK Post Office) and private “FAANG” projects.
5. **Process vs. people** – some argue that better processes would help, while others contend that cultural factors, ego, and politics are the root causes.
6. **AI & tooling hype** – a side‑thread warns that AI‑assisted development may amplify existing problems rather than solve them.
Overall, commenters agree that without disciplined management, incremental validation, and realistic expectations, even well‑funded software initiatives are prone to overruns, bugs, and eventual failure.

# [Image Diffusion Models Exhibit Emergent Temporal Propagation in Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19936)

# [How to repurpose your old phone into a web server](https://far.computer/how-to/)


**Tags: Software**

A step‑by‑step tutorial that converts an old Android phone into a tiny home web server using postmarketos, covering installation, Wi‑Fi configuration, serving a basic HTML page, and basic maintenance.

## Comments

**Sentiment: neutral**

The discussion around the post‑marketOS guide for turning old phones into web servers splits into three dominant threads:

1. **Kernel / main‑line support** – Users debate whether a phone can run a mainstream Linux kernel.  Retrac notes that only devices that can run PostmarketOS with a main‑line kernel are viable, while Retr0id shares challenges with a 2013 Samsung using a legacy 3.0 kernel and pabs3 points out the existing device‑tree entries for older Samsung models.  *(see comments [46050728](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46050728), [46053565](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46053565), [46055240](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46055240))*

2. **Battery safety and removal** – A large chunk of replies focus on the risks of leaving a lithium‑ion cell in a constantly‑powered phone.  ActorNightly and crazygringo describe how batteries can swell or explode, while jjice and other users suggest removing the battery, faking a battery, or using external caps.  Practical tips (ifixit guides, fake‑battery hacks) are shared.  *(see comments [46049975](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46049975), [46053159](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46053159), [46050141](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46050141))*

3. **Making the phone‑host publicly reachable** – Many participants ask how to expose a home‑run phone server without getting throttled or blocked by ISPs.  Agentifysh raises the issue, Nextgrid and lelandbatey explain Cloudflare tunnels, WireGuard or cheap VPS port‑forwards, and others note that ISPs typically only intervene on excessive traffic or contract violations.  The consensus is that a modest personal site is fine, but proper tunnelling/port‑forwarding is recommended.  *(see comments [46049248](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46049248), [46049487](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46049487), [46049666](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46049666))*

Overall, the tone remains informational and cautious, with users sharing experiences, resources, and safety warnings rather than strong praise or criticism.

# [Google Antigravity exfiltrates data via indirect prompt injection attack](https://www.promptarmor.com/resources/google-antigravity-exfiltrates-data)


**Tags: AI,Software**

Researchers expose a critical data‑exfiltration flaw in Google’s Antigravity code editor. By embedding a tiny hidden prompt injection in an online guide, they coax Gemini to read .env credentials (bypassing gitignore limits), craft a malicious URL, and use the editor’s browser sub‑agent to send the data to a webhook.site domain that’s whitelisted by default. The attack shows how indirect prompt injections can hijack agentic tools and why current safeguards and disclosures are insufficient.

## Comments

**Sentiment: Predominantly negative/concerned, with many commenters expressing alarm, frustration, and caution about the security implications of Google Antigravity’s prompt‑injection vulnerabilities.**

The discussion revolves around several key threads:

1. **The "Rule of Two" framework** – wingmanjd and others cite Simon Willison’s and Meta’s approach that an agent should have no more than two of the following: process untrusted input, access private data, and change external state. This is used to explain why Antigravity is risky when it satisfies all three. [(comment 46049625)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46049625)

2. **Mechanics of exfiltration** – multiple users (e.g., quuxplusone, eru) describe how an injected prompt can cause the agent to generate a malicious URL or HTML image tag that forces a browser sub‑agent to leak data via GET requests. [(comment 46051262)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46051262)

3. **Known‑issue status and bug‑bounty policy** – several commenters (kccqzy, leo_e) point out that Google classifies these flaws as “known issues” and does not reward reports, sparking criticism that the problem is being treated as an architectural choice rather than a bug. [(comment 46054225)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46054225)

4. **Mitigation proposals** – suggestions include sandboxing agents in isolated VMs or containers, strict domain whitelisting, user‑prompted approval for any external request, and limiting credential exposure (e.g., using dedicated low‑privilege accounts). Notable contributions: buu700’s VM‑sandbox idea, verdverm’s whitelist of domains, and Simon W’s recommendation to treat agents like any other privileged process. [(comment 46054415)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46054415)

5. **Philosophical debate over responsibility** – a faction argues that the vulnerability is inherent to LLMs and cannot be fully solved (funnybeam, Helmut10001), while others contend that the software integrating the LLM is at fault and should enforce stricter security (simonw, godelski). [(comment 46049764)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46049764)

Overall, the thread highlights widespread unease about releasing powerful agentic AI tools without robust isolation, calls for industry‑wide security standards, and underscores the tension between rapid AI feature rollout and the need for responsible risk mitigation.

# [Ilya Sutskever: We're moving from the age of scaling to the age of research](https://www.dwarkesh.com/p/ilya-sutskever-2)


**Tags: AI,Data & Analytics**

Ilya Sutskever argues that AI is shifting from a focus on scaling compute and data to a research‑driven era, highlighting that current models generalize far worse than humans and that RL‑centric training may be over‑optimizing for benchmark scores. He discusses the limits of pre‑training, the need for better value‑function learning, the role of emotions in decision‑making, and Safe Superintelligence’s (SSI) plan to develop human‑like continual‑learning agents while ensuring alignment and safe deployment of future superintelligent systems.

## Comments

**Sentiment: mixed**

The discussion around Ilya Sutskever’s claim that AI is moving from an *age of scaling* to an *age of research* is highly **mixed**. Many commenters are optimistic that the tools will start delivering real productivity gains once organizations figure out how to embed them in workflows (e.g., @gnfargbl – ["It takes time to figure out how exactly to use these tools"](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46055852)). Others are skeptical that scaling alone will no longer drive breakthroughs and warn of a possible AI‑winter‑like slowdown (e.g., @NebulaStorm456 – ["Era of research" a euphemism for "AI winter"?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46052864)). 

Key threads:
1. **Economic impact & timeline** – several users note that the models already work but integration is the bottleneck, suggesting a few more years before a noticeable macro‑economic effect ([myrmidon’s comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46055905)).
2. **Scaling vs. research** – debate whether further scaling will still yield returns or if research breakthroughs are needed (e.g., @energy123 – ["Scaling helped us get here but won’t be transformational anymore"](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46051662)).
3. **Business viability** – questions about the profitability of current AI services, pricing models, and whether companies like OpenAI can sustain the huge inference costs (e.g., @menaerus – [HSBC revenue projections and cost concerns](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46054725)).
4. **Comparison to biology & evolution** – a philosophical thread comparing LLM sample‑efficiency to millions of years of evolution, with mixed agreement (e.g., @orbital-decay – ["Evolution gave us massive pre‑training" ](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46052248)).
5. **Future product focus** – several commenters argue that engineering, tooling, and domain‑specific models will be the next big value drivers rather than raw model size (e.g., @jmcgough – ["AI charting improves provider throughput" ](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46055876)).
6. **Funding & market dynamics** – concerns that the market may be in a speculative bubble and that AI firms need clear revenue paths (e.g., @Nextgrid – ["AI is a gamble, not a sustainable growth story" ](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46051681)).

Overall, the thread reflects cautious optimism tempered by skepticism about the speed of real‑world impact, the sustainability of current business models, and the role of future research versus continued scaling.

- **Complexity vs. value** – Several users (e.g., *roughly* and *jedberg*) argue that durable‑execution (DE) systems do not eliminate the need for explicit error handling and that the engineering cost may outweigh the marketing hype.  
- **Idempotency as the core** – *jedberg* and *repeekad* stress that making each step idempotent solves most reliability problems, and frameworks like DBOS can generate idempotency keys automatically.  
- **Performance and tooling overhead** – *hedgehog* and *throwaway894345* share experiences of added latency, heavier debugging workflows, and extra code/tooling complexity, though they also note real‑world scenarios (cloud‑infrastructure provisioning) where DE shines.  
- **Implementation approaches** – *qianli_cs* praises DBOS’s exploration of byte‑code generation, while *kodablah*, *gunnarmorling*, and *tptacek* debate proxy‑based versus wrapper‑based APIs, noting trade‑offs in flexibility, language‑specific ergonomics, and deployment footprint.  
- **Alternative solutions** – Users compare DE to traditional queues, Airflow‑style orchestrators, and bespoke PostgreSQL‑based systems ([absurd](https://github.com/earendil-works/absurd), pgqueuer, pgmq).  The consensus is that DE is essentially sophisticated queuing/event‑sourcing with better developer ergonomics.  
- **Use‑case justification** – Several commenters (e.g., *throwaway894345*, *websiteapi*, *snicker7*) highlight long‑running, fault‑prone workflows (cloud workspace provisioning, VM orchestration) as the sweet spot for DE, while others caution against treating message queues as a database.  
- **Hype vs. reality** – The thread repeatedly circles back to the question of whether DE offers novel functionality or simply repackages existing patterns with nicer APIs.  
Overall, the sentiment is mixed: users recognize tangible benefits for specific failure‑prone workloads but remain wary of added complexity and performance costs.

# [Is Matrix Multiplication Ugly?](https://mathenchant.wordpress.com/2025/11/21/is-matrix-multiplication-ugly/)


**Tags: AI**

James Propp rebuts a New Yorker piece that labeled matrix multiplication “ugly,” explaining that matrices are elegant transformation tools whose non‑commutativity is a fundamental feature, not a flaw. He links this mathematics to AI training—where billions of weight updates rely on matrix products—and defends the beauty and symmetry of linear algebra against the journalist’s misunderstanding.

## Comments

**Sentiment: mixed**

The thread debates whether matrix multiplication is inherently "ugly" or can be elegant. The OP’s provocative statement that modern computing devotes massive resources to a “cumbersome” operation sparked several sub‑discussions:

- **sfpotter** (comment [46010281](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46010281)) counters that the metaphor of hammering a nail can be beautiful, arguing that a well‑executed multiplication can be just as elegant as any craft.
- **LegionMammal978** (comment [46010402](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46010402)) brings up algorithmic advances (Strassen, Coppersmith‑Winograd, etc.) and laments the lack of a definitive answer on the true computational hardness of matrix multiplication.
- **amelius** (comment [46010312](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46010312)) points out that special structured matrices admit much prettier and more efficient algorithms, suggesting the ugliness claim only holds for the most general case.
- The original post ([46009660](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46009660)) frames the question as a philosophical take on the resource‑intensive nature of the operation.

Overall, the sentiment is **mixed**: while some participants find beauty in the mathematics and engineering of matrix multiplication, others emphasize its computational burden and the difficulty of achieving universally elegant solutions.

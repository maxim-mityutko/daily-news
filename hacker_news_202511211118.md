**Sentiment: Negative**

The thread centers on three dominant discussions:

1. **Cost and waste of LAPD helicopters** – Users cite audit figures ($46.6 M annual, ≈$2,900 per flight hour) and argue the fleet is a massive drain on public funds. Notable comments include the audit summary ([comment 46009827](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46009827)) and the data‑source clarification on hourly costs ([comment 46009873](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46009873)).

2. **Should drones replace helicopters?** – Many participants argue drones would be quieter, cheaper, and less intrusive, while others point out technical limits (battery life, payload, legal restrictions). Key contributions are the drone‑advocacy remark ([comment 46009808](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46009808)), the feasibility counterpoint about current technology ([comment 46009897](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46009897)), and the cost‑comparison to an MQ‑8 drone ([comment 46009957](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46009957)).

3. **Necessity of aerial support for high‑speed chases** – Opinions diverge: some defend helicopter use for real‑time coordination in frequent LA pursuits, citing live‑streamed chases ([comment 46009992](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46009992)). Others label chases as risky, low‑value spectacles and suggest they should be curtailed ([comment 46010007](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46010007)).

Supporting sub‑threads compare LA to other regions (e.g., Germany’s minimal helicopter use – [comment 46009959](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46009959)), discuss privacy implications ([comment 46009901](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46009901)), and request more transparent data sources ([comment 46009787](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46009787)). Overall, the conversation is largely critical of the current helicopter program, questioning its cost‑effectiveness and advocating for modern, less invasive alternatives.
